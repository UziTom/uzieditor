# uzieditor
Uz3d1t0r is a very very basic text editor made by UziTom. This was originally only going to be private but I decided to publish it on github & the Project Dream Discord server. This was all made in under 2 hours from scratch and I only know like 20 different functions and some basic stuff with TKinter. This is most likely never going to be updated (I might update when I take breaks from BATCH RPG coding), but if you have any feedback please give me some on discord (not server my dm): ~~#9556~~ copy and paste until the last number.
